# data-cleaning-project
this is a Repo for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. It contains the R code, the codebook, and the tidy data set for this assignment.

CodeBook.md describes how to use all these variables and how these work was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the listed 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio. Here are the five steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is the output of the final step
